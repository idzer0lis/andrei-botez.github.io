                <p>You’re a non-technical (or highly technical) executive or entrepreneur and need your Minimum Viable Product built. I can help.</p>

                <h4>How I can help</h4>
                <p> When we work together, we’ll build an MVP together. I’ll work with you and your stakeholders to:
                </p>

                <p>Translate your big picture vision into a buildable version 1</p>
                <p>De-risk your build by talking to potential customers to validate what the right set of features are for your v1</p>
                <p>Source and lead a development and design team to build your v1, or work with your team to do so</p>
                <p>Ensure technical tradeoffs are made in service of the business</p>
                <p>Write detailed specifications to ensure you get the product needs on the appropriate schedule and budget</p>
                <p>Project manage the development team through to launch and beyond</p>
                <p>Hire an internal development team for you and transition the product to them</p>
                <p>Ensure you have the monitoring, process, and team in place to keep your app running and your data safe</p>
                <p>Ensure you’re tracking and reporting on the right metrics</p>
                <p>Prioritize and maintain your product roadmap</p>
                <h4>Why me?</h4>

                <p>This isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve built a few MVPs for myself and clients in the last years.</p>
                <p>I started my career as a developer in 2010 and worked for brands like ING Bank, Avaya, Uniper and individuals with small budgets.
                </p>

                <h4>What does working together look like?</h4>
                <p>First, we’ll create your Roadmap</p>
                <p>We’ll start with a small engagement called a Roadmapping session The session will take one to four hours depending on the scope of your project. In it, you and your stakeholders will share your vision and all the details about your product (the customer, business model, what v1 looks like, etc).</p>
                <p> I’ll consolidate this into your Roadmap document that describes each screen and flow in your v1 along with wireframes for key screens (wireframes are unbranded screens showing your app’s functionality).
                </p>
                <p>When it’s done, we’ll walk through the doc together. You can then give the Roadmap back to me to build it, or you can give it to someone else - no harm no foul. It’s a great way to de-risk working together and establish a concrete plan to build your application.</p>
                <p>Then, we’ll build it</p>
                <p>Regardless of who’s building the app (me or your team) we’ll have a weekly alignment meeting to ensure neither the build nor business are roadblocked.</p>
                <p>You’ll see progress regularly (usually every two weeks).</p>
                <p>I’ll be available to answer your questions about the build.</p>
                <p>You’ll benefit from my extensive knowledge about the services necessary to run, monitor, and instrument your application. You won’t have to worry about the services to use for analytics, email marketing, web hosting, application monitoring, etc - I’ll make recommendations based on your needs.
                </p>
                <p>We’ll maintain and transition</p>
                <p> You can work with me to maintain and continue to build your app. Eventually we’ll transition it to your team (I can interview and hire your team first if necessary).
                </p>
                <p>Email me at <a href="mailto:mihailabotezandrei@gmail.com">mihailabotezandrei@gmail.com</a>. I'll get back to you within one business day.

                <h4>Data collection when visiting our website</h4>
                <br/>
                <h5>1. Collection of general data and information</h5>
                <p>The website of shady softworks SRL-D collects a series of general data and information each time the website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system. This general data and information is stored in the server's log files.
                    The browser types and versions used, the operating system used by the accessing system, the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrer), the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website, the date and the time of access to the website, an Internet protocol address (IP address), the Internet service provider of the accessing system and other similar data and information that serve to avert danger in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When using this general data and information, shady softworks SRL-D does not draw any conclusions about the person concerned. Rather, this information is required in order to correctly deliver the content of our website, to optimize the content of our website and the advertising for it, to ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website, as well as to law enforcement authorities in the event of a cyber attack who are necessary for law enforcement Provide information. This anonymously collected data and information is therefore statistically evaluated by shady softworks SRL-D on the one hand and also with the aim of increasing data protection and data security in our company in order to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
                </p>
                <h5>2. Cookies</h5>
                <p>
                    shady softworks website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored and saved on a computer system via an Internet browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using cookies, shady softworks SRL-D can provide users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time using an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common internet browsers. If the person concerned deactivates the setting of cookies in the internet browser used, under certain circumstances not all functions of our website can be used to their full extent.
                </p>
                <h5></h5>
                <p>
                    On the website of shady softworks SRL-D you can subscribe to our company's newsletter. Registration data: To register for the newsletter, please enter your e-mail address and your first and last name in order to address them personally in the newsletter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    shady softworks SRL-D informs about the company's offers at regular intervals by means of a newsletter. The newsletter of our company can only be received by the data subject if 1. the data subject has a valid e-mail address and 2. the data subject registers for the newsletter. For legal reasons, a confirmation email will be sent to the email address entered by the data subject for the first time for sending the newsletter in a double opt-in procedure. This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the email address as the person concerned has authorized the receipt of the newsletter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When registering for the newsletter, we also save the IP address assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) of the computer system used by the person concerned at the time of registration, as well as the date and time of registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to be able to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later point in time and therefore serves to provide legal protection for the person responsible for processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The service provider through which the newsletter is sent is based in the USA. Your data will be processed on servers / data centers in the USA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The personal data collected when you register for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by email if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or for a registration in this regard, as could be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter offer or changes in the technical circumstances. The personal data collected as part of the newsletter service is not passed on to third parties. The person concerned can cancel the subscription to our newsletter at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data that the data subject has given us for sending the newsletter can be revoked at any time. For the purpose of withdrawing consent, there is a corresponding link in every newsletter. There is also the option of unsubscribing from the newsletter at any time by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:mail@shadysoftworks.com"> mail@shadysoftworks.com </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After revocation, this personal data will be deleted by the controller. Unsubscribing from receiving the newsletter automatically interprets shady softworks SRL-D as a revocation.
                </p>

                <h5>3. Subscription to our newsletter</h5>
                <p>
                    The newsletter is sent using the mail service provider "MailChimp", a newsletter mailing platform of the US provider Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE # 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA. You can view the data protection regulations of the shipping service provider here: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/"> https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/ </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Rocket Science Group LLC d / b / a MailChimp is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thereby offers a guarantee to comply with the European data protection level (<a href = "https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id= a2zt0000000TO6hAAG & status = Active "> https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG&status=Active </a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shipping service provider can process the recipient's data in pseudonymous form, i.e. use without assignment to a user, to optimize or improve their own services, e.g. use for technical optimization of the dispatch and presentation of the newsletter or for statistical purposes. However, the shipping service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.
                </p>
                <h5>4. Newsletter tracking</h5>
                <p>
                    The shady softworks SRL-D newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. I.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use a shipping service provider, from their server. As part of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval, are initially collected
                    This information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their access locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or the access times. The statistical surveys also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our aim nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.

                <h4>Web analytics services</h4>
                <br/>
                <h5>1. Google Analytics</h5>
                <p>
                    This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the user is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active"> https: // www .privacyshield.gov / participant? id = a2zt000000001L5AAI & status = Active </a>).

                    Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with other services related to the use of this online offer and the internet. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other Google data. The users can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly; Users can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to their use of the online offer and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: <a href = " http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de </a>.

                <h5>2. Google Tag Manager</h5>
                <p>
                    This website uses the "Google Tag Manager" program from Google LLC., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). The Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a tag management system with which website tags can be managed. The Tag Manager does not collect any personal data itself. Tags triggered by Tag Manager may collect data. The Tag Manager does not access these. Insofar as there is a deactivation at the domain or cookie level, this remains for all tags that have been implemented with the GTM.
                </p>
                <h5>5. Newsletter - measuring success</h5>
                <p>
                    The controller has integrated Google AdWords on this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google AdWords is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of Google AdWords is to advertise our website by displaying interest-based advertising on the websites of third-party companies and in the search engine results of the Google search engine and by displaying third-party advertising on our website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a so-called conversion cookie is placed on the data subject's information technology system by Google. What cookies are has already been explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain sub-pages have been accessed on our website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to generate visitor statistics for our website. These visit statistics are in turn used by us to determine the total number of users who were referred to us via AdWords ads, i.e. to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads for the future . Neither our company nor any other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could be used to identify the data subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conversion cookie is used to store personal information, such as the websites visited by the data subject. Each time you visit our website, personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass this personal data collected via the technical process on to third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting of the internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the data subject has the option to object to Google's interest-based advertising. For this purpose, the data subject must call up the link www.google.de/settings/ads from each of the internet browsers they use and make the desired settings there.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We use content or service offers from third-party providers within our online offer to provide their content and services, such as Include videos or fonts (hereinafter referred to as “content”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore required to display this content. We strive to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored in cookies on the user's device and contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other information on the use of our online offer, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.
